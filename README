2. Focal data set description: The Senior Center Database includes a list of Senior Centers in Howard County.  It lists their Street Address, City, Zipcode, geom or the coordinates to plot the address on a map as well as a Facility ID and a UID. The Senior Centers are identified as Senior_Centers 1-12. Several Centers are in the same zipcode.
3. Two data sets that could be combined with the Senior Center Database are Assisted Living Small and Assisted Living Large. 
<br><p>
Assisted Living Small gives a list of licensed assisted living facilities with less than 17 beds and was updated last in October of 2014. It lists a Facility ID, Name, Street Address, City, State, Zipcode, Total Number of Beds and geom or coordinates to plot on a map.

Assisted Living Large gives a list of licensed assisted living facilities with 17 or more beds and was last updated in October of 2014.  It lists a Facility ID, Name, Street Address, City, State, Zipcode, Total Number of Beds and geom or coordinates to plot on a map.

4.  By combining the datasets, I could make a map that would plot the Senior Centers and the assisted living facilities, both large and small, so that we could answer the question: How accessible are Howard County Seniors Centers to seniors living in assisted living facilities?  The map could use circles that would increase in size based on the number of beds in the Assisted Living Facility.  Small facilities could be shown in green dots and large facilities with blue dots.  The Senior Centers could be shown in red and a key would appear in the lower right-hand corner explaining the colors and sizes.
